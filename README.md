This is Airsoft Team Balancer App

## Getting Started

This App will help you with splitting your Airsoft friends into two balanced teams of Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists!

Start by adding players with the "ADD NEW" button, select player class Rifleman <img src='public/icons/m4.png'  style="width:40px; transform: translateY(15px); filter:invert() "/> or Sniper <img src='public/icons/sniper.png'  style="width:40px; transform: translateY(15px);  filter:invert()"/>, then press "CREATE TEAMS".

You can press "CREATE TEAMS" again, if you don't like how your teams look.
